# Python from A to Z: Part 2 - Control Flow and Logic Mastery

Welcome back! In Part 1, we covered Python basics. Now, we'll learn how to make decisions and repeat actions—the heart of programming logic. By the end, you'll write programs that think and adapt.

## Quick Recap: What We Learned

- Variables and data types
- Operators (arithmetic, comparison, logical)
- Input and output
- Basic Python syntax

Let's build on this foundation!

## Conditional Statements: Making Decisions

### The if Statement

Programs need to make decisions based on conditions.

```python
# Basic if statement
age = 18

if age >= 18:
    print("You can vote!")
    print("Welcome to adulthood")

# If condition is False, nothing prints
age = 15

if age >= 18:
    print("This won't print")

print("This always prints (outside if block)")
```

**Key Points**:
- Condition must evaluate to `True` or `False`
- Colon `:` is required after condition
- Indentation defines the block (4 spaces standard)

### The if-else Statement

What if you want to do something when condition is False?

```python
age = 16

if age >= 18:
    print("You can vote!")
else:
    print("You're too young to vote")
    print("Wait a few more years")

# Both blocks are indented
# Only ONE block executes
```

### The if-elif-else Statement

Multiple conditions? Use `elif` (else-if).

```python
score = 85

if score >= 90:
    grade = "A"
elif score >= 80:
    grade = "B"
elif score >= 70:
    grade = "C"
elif score >= 60:
    grade = "D"
else:
    grade = "F"

print(f"Your grade is: {grade}")
```

**Flow**:
1. Python checks conditions **top to bottom**
2. First `True` condition executes its block
3. Rest are **skipped** (even if True)
4. `else` runs only if **all** conditions are False

**Interview Tip**: Order matters!
```python
# ❌ Bad: This always gives "Minor"
age = 25
if age > 0:
    print("Minor")  # This runs for ALL positive ages
elif age >= 18:
    print("Adult")  # Never reached!

# ✅ Good: Most specific conditions first
age = 25
if age >= 18:
    print("Adult")
elif age > 0:
    print("Minor")
```

### Nested if Statements

Conditions inside conditions.

```python
age = 20
has_license = True

if age >= 18:
    print("You're old enough to drive")
    if has_license:
        print("You can drive!")
    else:
        print("But you need a license")
else:
    print("You're too young to drive")
```

**Best Practice**: Avoid deep nesting (hard to read).
```python
# Instead of deep nesting, use logical operators
age = 20
has_license = True

# Better approach
if age >= 18 and has_license:
    print("You can drive!")
elif age >= 18:
    print("You need a license")
else:
    print("You're too young")
```

### Ternary Operator (Conditional Expression)

One-line if-else for simple cases.

```python
# Traditional if-else
age = 20
if age >= 18:
    status = "Adult"
else:
    status = "Minor"

# Ternary operator (Pythonic!)
age = 20
status = "Adult" if age >= 18 else "Minor"

# Syntax: value_if_true if condition else value_if_false

# Practical example
number = 15
result = "Even" if number % 2 == 0 else "Odd"
print(result)  # "Odd"
```

**Interview Question**: When to use ternary?
- **Use**: Simple assignments based on one condition
- **Avoid**: Complex logic or multiple conditions (hurts readability)

### Match-Case (Python 3.10+)

The modern switch-case alternative.

```python
# Old way (multiple if-elif)
command = "start"

if command == "start":
    print("Starting...")
elif command == "stop":
    print("Stopping...")
elif command == "pause":
    print("Pausing...")
else:
    print("Unknown command")

# New way (match-case)
command = "start"

match command:
    case "start":
        print("Starting...")
    case "stop":
        print("Stopping...")
    case "pause":
        print("Pausing...")
    case _:  # Default case (like 'else')
        print("Unknown command")
```

**Advanced match-case patterns**:
```python
# Matching multiple values
day = "Saturday"

match day:
    case "Monday" | "Tuesday" | "Wednesday" | "Thursday" | "Friday":
        print("Weekday")
    case "Saturday" | "Sunday":
        print("Weekend!")
    case _:
        print("Invalid day")

# Pattern matching with conditions (guards)
number = 7

match number:
    case n if n < 0:
        print("Negative")
    case 0:
        print("Zero")
    case n if n > 0:
        print("Positive")

# Matching tuples
point = (0, 5)

match point:
    case (0, 0):
        print("Origin")
    case (0, y):
        print(f"On Y-axis at {y}")
    case (x, 0):
        print(f"On X-axis at {x}")
    case (x, y):
        print(f"Point at ({x}, {y})")
```

## Loops: Repeating Actions

### The for Loop

Iterate over sequences (lists, strings, ranges).

```python
# Looping through a list
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)

# Output:
# apple
# banana
# cherry

# Looping through a string
for char in "Python":
    print(char)

# Output: P y t h o n (each on new line)
```

**The range() function**:
```python
# range(stop): 0 to stop-1
for i in range(5):
    print(i)  # 0 1 2 3 4

# range(start, stop): start to stop-1
for i in range(2, 6):
    print(i)  # 2 3 4 5

# range(start, stop, step): with custom increment
for i in range(0, 10, 2):
    print(i)  # 0 2 4 6 8

# Counting backwards
for i in range(5, 0, -1):
    print(i)  # 5 4 3 2 1
```

**Enumerate: Getting index and value**:
```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

# Without enumerate
for i in range(len(fruits)):
    print(f"{i}: {fruits[i]}")

# With enumerate (Pythonic!)
for index, fruit in enumerate(fruits):
    print(f"{index}: {fruit}")

# Start index from 1
for index, fruit in enumerate(fruits, start=1):
    print(f"{index}. {fruit}")

# Output:
# 1. apple
# 2. banana
# 3. cherry
```

### The while Loop

Repeats while condition is True.

```python
# Basic while loop
count = 0

while count < 5:
    print(f"Count: {count}")
    count += 1

# Output: Count: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

# User input validation
while True:
    password = input("Enter password (min 6 chars): ")
    if len(password) >= 6:
        print("Password accepted!")
        break  # Exit loop
    print("Password too short, try again")
```

**Common Pitfall: Infinite Loops**
```python
# ❌ Infinite loop (never ends!)
# count = 0
# while count < 5:
#     print(count)
#     # Forgot to increment count!

# ✅ Always ensure loop eventually becomes False
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1  # Don't forget this!
```

### Loop Control: break, continue, pass

#### break: Exit loop immediately

```python
# Find first even number
numbers = [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10]

for num in numbers:
    if num % 2 == 0:
        print(f"First even number: {num}")
        break  # Stop searching

# Search with while loop
i = 0
while i < 100:
    if i ** 2 > 50:
        print(f"First square > 50: {i}^2 = {i**2}")
        break
    i += 1
```

#### continue: Skip current iteration

```python
# Print only odd numbers
for num in range(1, 11):
    if num % 2 == 0:
        continue  # Skip even numbers
    print(num)

# Output: 1 3 5 7 9

# Skip negative numbers
numbers = [1, -5, 3, -2, 8, -7, 10]

for num in numbers:
    if num < 0:
        continue  # Skip negatives
    print(num)

# Output: 1 3 8 10
```

#### pass: Do nothing (placeholder)

```python
# Useful during development
for i in range(5):
    if i == 3:
        pass  # TODO: implement special case later
    print(i)

# Empty function/class placeholders
def function_to_implement():
    pass  # Will add code later

class MyClass:
    pass  # Will add methods later
```

### Loop else Clause

Executes if loop completes **without** break.

```python
# Check if number is prime
number = 17

for i in range(2, number):
    if number % i == 0:
        print(f"{number} is not prime")
        break
else:
    # Runs only if break was NOT called
    print(f"{number} is prime")

# Search in list
search = "grape"
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

for fruit in fruits:
    if fruit == search:
        print(f"Found {search}!")
        break
else:
    # Runs if item not found
    print(f"{search} not in list")
```

**Interview Insight**: Very few languages have loop-else. Knowing this makes you stand out!

### Nested Loops

Loops inside loops.

```python
# Multiplication table
for i in range(1, 6):
    for j in range(1, 6):
        print(f"{i} x {j} = {i*j}")
    print()  # Blank line after each table

# Pattern printing (interview favorite!)
# Print triangle
for i in range(1, 6):
    for j in range(i):
        print("*", end="")
    print()  # New line

# Output:
# *
# **
# ***
# ****
# *****

# Right-aligned triangle
for i in range(1, 6):
    # Print spaces
    for j in range(5 - i):
        print(" ", end="")
    # Print stars
    for k in range(i):
        print("*", end="")
    print()

# Output:
#     *
#    **
#   ***
#  ****
# *****
```

### List Comprehensions (Loop Alternative)

Concise way to create lists.

```python
# Traditional approach
squares = []
for i in range(1, 6):
    squares.append(i ** 2)
print(squares)  # [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

# List comprehension (Pythonic!)
squares = [i ** 2 for i in range(1, 6)]
print(squares)  # [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

# With condition
evens = [i for i in range(1, 11) if i % 2 == 0]
print(evens)  # [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

# Transform strings
words = ["hello", "world", "python"]
upper_words = [word.upper() for word in words]
print(upper_words)  # ['HELLO', 'WORLD', 'PYTHON']

# Nested list comprehension
matrix = [[i*j for j in range(1, 4)] for i in range(1, 4)]
print(matrix)
# [[1, 2, 3],
#  [2, 4, 6],
#  [3, 6, 9]]
```

## Common Loop Patterns (Interview Gold!)

### 1. Two Pointers Pattern

```python
# Check if string is palindrome
def is_palindrome(s):
    left = 0
    right = len(s) - 1

    while left < right:
        if s[left] != s[right]:
            return False
        left += 1
        right -= 1

    return True

print(is_palindrome("racecar"))  # True
print(is_palindrome("hello"))    # False
```

### 2. Sliding Window Pattern

```python
# Find max sum of k consecutive elements
def max_sum_subarray(arr, k):
    n = len(arr)
    if n < k:
        return None

    # Calculate sum of first window
    window_sum = sum(arr[:k])
    max_sum = window_sum

    # Slide the window
    for i in range(k, n):
        window_sum = window_sum - arr[i-k] + arr[i]
        max_sum = max(max_sum, window_sum)

    return max_sum

arr = [1, 4, 2, 10, 23, 3, 1, 0, 20]
k = 4
print(max_sum_subarray(arr, k))  # 39 (10+23+3+1+0+20)
```

### 3. Fast and Slow Pointers

```python
# Find middle of list
def find_middle(arr):
    slow = fast = 0

    while fast < len(arr) - 1:
        slow += 1
        fast += 2

    return arr[slow]

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(find_middle(numbers))  # 3
```

### 4. Accumulator Pattern

```python
# Calculate factorial
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result

print(factorial(5))  # 120

# Sum of digits
def sum_digits(n):
    total = 0
    while n > 0:
        total += n % 10
        n //= 10
    return total

print(sum_digits(12345))  # 15
```

        print("*" * (2 * i - 1))

print_pyramid(5)
```

## Interview Questions - Part 2

### Q1: What's the difference between `break` and `continue`?
**Answer**:
- `break`: Exits the loop immediately
- `continue`: Skips current iteration, continues with next

```python
for i in range(5):
    if i == 2:
        break
    print(i)  # Output: 0 1

for i in range(5):
    if i == 2:
        continue
    print(i)  # Output: 0 1 3 4
```

### Q2: What does loop-else do?
**Answer**: `else` block runs if loop completes without `break`.

```python
for i in range(3):
    print(i)
else:
    print("Loop completed normally")
# Output: 0 1 2 Loop completed normally

for i in range(3):
    if i == 1:
        break
else:
    print("This won't print")
```

### Q3: How to exit nested loops?
**Answer**: Use a flag or function with return.

```python
# Using flag
found = False
for i in range(3):
    for j in range(3):
        if i == j == 1:
            found = True
            break
    if found:
        break

# Using function (cleaner)
def search():
    for i in range(3):
        for j in range(3):
            if i == j == 1:
                return "Found!"
    return "Not found"
```

### Q4: What's more efficient: `while` or `for`?
**Answer**: Same performance. Choose based on use case:
- Use `for` when you know iterations (ranges, lists)
- Use `while` for condition-based loops (user input, searches)

### Q5: Explain this code:
```python
x = [i for i in range(10) if i % 2 == 0]
```
**Answer**: List comprehension creating list of even numbers 0-9.
Equivalent to:
```python
x = []
for i in range(10):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        x.append(i)
# x = [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Forgetting Colon
```python
# ❌ Wrong
if x > 5
    print("Greater")

# ✅ Correct
if x > 5:
    print("Greater")
```

### 2. Wrong Indentation
```python
# ❌ Wrong
if True:
print("Hello")  # IndentationError

# ✅ Correct
if True:
    print("Hello")
```

### 3. Using = Instead of ==
```python
x = 5
# ❌ Assignment in condition
if x = 5:  # SyntaxError
    print("Five")

# ✅ Comparison
if x == 5:
    print("Five")
```

### 4. Infinite Loop
```python
# ❌ Never ends
i = 0
while i < 5:
    print(i)
    # Forgot i += 1

# ✅ Proper increment
i = 0
while i < 5:
    print(i)
    i += 1
```

### 5. Modifying List While Iterating
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# ❌ Dangerous
for i in range(len(numbers)):
    if numbers[i] % 2 == 0:
        numbers.pop(i)  # Index error!

# ✅ Create new list
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
odd_numbers = [n for n in numbers if n % 2 != 0]
```

## Performance Tips

### 1. Use `in` for Membership Testing
```python
# ❌ Slower
found = False
for item in my_list:
    if item == search_value:
        found = True
        break

# ✅ Faster
found = search_value in my_list
```

### 2. List Comprehensions vs Loops
```python
# ❌ Slower
squares = []
for i in range(1000):
    squares.append(i ** 2)

# ✅ Faster
squares = [i ** 2 for i in range(1000)]
```

### 3. Avoid Nested Loops When Possible
```python
# ❌ O(n²) - slow for large lists
for item1 in list1:
    for item2 in list2:
        if item1 == item2:
            print("Match!")

# ✅ O(n) - use sets
set1 = set(list1)
for item in list2:
    if item in set1:
        print("Match!")
```

## Key Takeaways

✅ Use `if-elif-else` for multiple conditions
✅ `match-case` is cleaner than multiple `if-elif` (Python 3.10+)
✅ `for` loops iterate over sequences; `while` loops run while condition is True
✅ `break` exits loop; `continue` skips iteration; `pass` does nothing
✅ Loop-else runs if loop completes without `break`
✅ List comprehensions are Pythonic and often faster
✅ Master common patterns: two pointers, sliding window, accumulator

## What's Next?

In **Part 3**, we'll explore:
- Functions: built-in and user-defined
- Parameters and return values
- Lambda functions
- Recursion and recursive problem-solving
- Function decorators basics
- Scope and namespaces

---

**Challenge**: Before Part 3, solve these:

1. **Leap Year Checker**: Determine if a year is a leap year
2. **Armstrong Number**: Check if sum of cubes of digits equals the number (153 = 1³ + 5³ + 3³)
3. **Fibonacci Sequence**: Print first n Fibonacci numbers
4. **Diamond Pattern**: Print diamond shape with stars

Try solving these on your own—practice makes perfect! 🐍
