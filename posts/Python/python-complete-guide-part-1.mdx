# Python from A to Z: Part 1 - Getting Started with Python Basics

Welcome to your journey into Python programming! This is Part 1 of our comprehensive series designed to take you from absolute beginner to interview-ready Python developer. No prior programming experience required—we'll build your knowledge step by step.

## Why Python?

Before we dive in, let's understand why Python is an excellent choice:

- **Beginner-friendly**: Clean syntax that reads like English
- **Industry standard**: Used by Google, Netflix, NASA, and thousands of companies
- **Versatile**: Web development, data science, AI, automation, and more
- **In-demand**: One of the most sought-after skills in tech interviews

## Setting Up Your Python Environment

### Installation

**Windows:**
1. Visit [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Download Python 3.11 or later
3. Run installer and **check "Add Python to PATH"**
4. Verify: Open Command Prompt and type `python --version`

**Mac:**
```bash
# Using Homebrew (recommended)
brew install python3

# Verify installation
python3 --version
```

**Linux:**
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip

# Verify
python3 --version
```

### Your First Python Program

Open your terminal or Command Prompt and type:
```bash
python3
```

You'll see the Python interactive shell (REPL). Try this:
```python
>>> print("Hello, Python!")
Hello, Python!
```

Congratulations! You've written your first Python code.

## Understanding Variables

### What is a Variable?

Think of a variable as a labeled box that stores information. You can change what's inside the box anytime.

```python
# Creating variables (no need to declare type!)
name = "Alice"
age = 25
height = 5.6
is_student = True

# Python automatically determines the type
print(name)    # Alice
print(age)     # 25
```

### Variable Naming Rules

```python
# ✅ Valid names
user_name = "Bob"
user1 = "Charlie"
_private = "secret"
firstName = "Dave"  # camelCase (less common in Python)

# ❌ Invalid names
2users = "error"     # Can't start with number
user-name = "error"  # Can't use hyphens
class = "error"      # Can't use Python keywords
```

**Python Convention**: Use `snake_case` for variables (all lowercase with underscores).

```python
# Preferred Python style
user_name = "Alice"
total_count = 100
is_valid = True
```

## Data Types: The Building Blocks

Python has several built-in data types. Let's explore the fundamental ones:

### 1. Integers (int)

Whole numbers without decimal points.

```python
age = 25
year = 2025
negative = -10
large_number = 1_000_000  # Underscores for readability

print(type(age))  # <class 'int'>

# Integer operations
sum_result = 10 + 5      # 15
difference = 10 - 3      # 7
product = 4 * 5          # 20
quotient = 20 // 3       # 6 (integer division)
power = 2 ** 3           # 8 (2 to the power of 3)
modulus = 10 % 3         # 1 (remainder)
```

### 2. Floats (float)

Numbers with decimal points.

```python
price = 19.99
temperature = -5.5
scientific = 1.5e-4  # 0.00015 in scientific notation

print(type(price))  # <class 'float'>

# Float operations
result = 10.5 + 3.2      # 13.7
division = 10 / 3        # 3.333... (normal division always returns float)
```

**Interview Tip**: Be careful with floating-point arithmetic!
```python
# Floating-point precision issues
print(0.1 + 0.2)  # 0.30000000000000004 (not exactly 0.3!)

# For exact decimal calculations, use the decimal module
from decimal import Decimal
result = Decimal('0.1') + Decimal('0.2')  # Exactly 0.3
```

### 3. Strings (str)

Text data enclosed in quotes.

```python
single_quote = 'Hello'
double_quote = "Hello"
multiline = """This is a
multiline string
across multiple lines"""

# Strings are immutable (can't be changed)
name = "Python"
# name[0] = "J"  # ❌ This would cause an error

# String concatenation
first_name = "John"
last_name = "Doe"
full_name = first_name + " " + last_name  # "John Doe"

# String repetition
laugh = "ha" * 3  # "hahaha"

# String methods (we'll explore more in Part 5)
message = "hello world"
print(message.upper())       # "HELLO WORLD"
print(message.capitalize())  # "Hello world"
print(message.title())       # "Hello World"
print(len(message))          # 11 (length of string)
```

### 4. Booleans (bool)

True or False values.

```python
is_active = True
is_logged_in = False

# Boolean results from comparisons
print(5 > 3)    # True
print(10 == 5)  # False

# Truthy and Falsy values (important for interviews!)
# Falsy values: False, 0, 0.0, "", None, [], {}, ()
# Everything else is Truthy

if 0:
    print("This won't print")  # 0 is Falsy

if "text":
    print("This will print")  # Non-empty string is Truthy
```

### 5. None Type

Represents absence of value (like null in other languages).

```python
result = None

# Commonly used to initialize variables
user_name = None

# Check for None
if user_name is None:
    print("No user name set")

# Interview Tip: Use 'is' not '==' for None comparison
if result is None:  # ✅ Correct
    pass

if result == None:  # ❌ Works but not Pythonic
    pass
```

## Type Conversion

Python allows converting between types:

```python
# String to Integer
age_string = "25"
age_int = int(age_string)  # 25

# Integer to String
number = 100
text = str(number)  # "100"

# String to Float
price_string = "19.99"
price_float = float(price_string)  # 19.99

# Integer to Float
whole = 5
decimal = float(whole)  # 5.0

# Float to Integer (truncates, doesn't round!)
pi = 3.14159
rounded = int(pi)  # 3 (not 4!)

# For proper rounding, use round()
properly_rounded = round(pi)  # 3
```

**Common Interview Pitfall**:
```python
# Be careful with invalid conversions
try:
    number = int("abc")  # ❌ ValueError!
except ValueError:
    print("Can't convert 'abc' to integer")

# Always validate before converting in production code
user_input = "25"
if user_input.isdigit():
    number = int(user_input)
else:
    print("Invalid number")
```

## Operators in Python

### Arithmetic Operators

```python
a = 10
b = 3

print(a + b)   # 13 (addition)
print(a - b)   # 7 (subtraction)
print(a * b)   # 30 (multiplication)
print(a / b)   # 3.333... (division, always returns float)
print(a // b)  # 3 (floor division, returns integer)
print(a % b)   # 1 (modulus, remainder)
print(a ** b)  # 1000 (exponentiation, 10^3)
```

### Comparison Operators

```python
x = 5
y = 10

print(x == y)  # False (equal to)
print(x != y)  # True (not equal to)
print(x > y)   # False (greater than)
print(x < y)   # True (less than)
print(x >= y)  # False (greater than or equal)
print(x <= y)  # True (less than or equal)
```

### Logical Operators

```python
# and: Both conditions must be True
print(True and True)    # True
print(True and False)   # False

# or: At least one condition must be True
print(True or False)    # True
print(False or False)   # False

# not: Reverses the boolean value
print(not True)         # False
print(not False)        # True

# Practical example
age = 25
has_license = True

can_drive = age >= 18 and has_license  # True

# Short-circuit evaluation (interview favorite!)
def expensive_check():
    print("This function is called")
    return True

# 'and' stops if first condition is False
result = False and expensive_check()  # expensive_check NOT called
print(result)  # False

# 'or' stops if first condition is True
result = True or expensive_check()  # expensive_check NOT called
print(result)  # True
```

### Assignment Operators

```python
x = 10  # Basic assignment

# Compound assignment operators (shorthand)
x += 5   # Same as: x = x + 5 → x is now 15
x -= 3   # Same as: x = x - 3 → x is now 12
x *= 2   # Same as: x = x * 2 → x is now 24
x //= 4  # Same as: x = x // 4 → x is now 6
x %= 5   # Same as: x = x % 5 → x is now 1
x **= 3  # Same as: x = x ** 3 → x is now 1

# Multiple assignment (Pythonic!)
a, b, c = 1, 2, 3
print(a, b, c)  # 1 2 3

# Swap values (interview favorite!)
x, y = 10, 20
x, y = y, x  # Swap in one line!
print(x, y)  # 20 10
```

### Identity Operators

```python
# 'is' checks if two variables point to the same object
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = a
c = [1, 2, 3]

print(a is b)      # True (same object)
print(a is c)      # False (different objects, same content)
print(a == c)      # True (same content)

# 'is not' checks if two variables DON'T point to same object
print(a is not c)  # True
```

### Membership Operators

```python
# 'in' checks if value exists in sequence
text = "Python Programming"
print("Python" in text)     # True
print("Java" in text)       # False

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(3 in numbers)         # True
print(10 in numbers)        # False

# 'not in' checks if value doesn't exist
print("Ruby" not in text)   # True
```

## Input and Output

### The print() Function

```python
# Basic printing
print("Hello, World!")

# Printing multiple values
name = "Alice"
age = 25
print("Name:", name, "Age:", age)  # Name: Alice Age: 25

# Changing separator
print("Python", "is", "awesome", sep="-")  # Python-is-awesome

# Changing end character (default is newline)
print("Hello", end=" ")
print("World")  # Hello World (on same line)

# Formatted strings (f-strings) - Modern Python
name = "Bob"
age = 30
print(f"My name is {name} and I'm {age} years old")

# Expressions inside f-strings
x = 10
y = 20
print(f"The sum of {x} and {y} is {x + y}")

# Formatting numbers
pi = 3.14159265
print(f"Pi rounded to 2 decimals: {pi:.2f}")  # 3.14
```

### The input() Function

```python
# Reading user input (always returns a string!)
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")

# Converting input to integer
age_string = input("How old are you? ")
age = int(age_string)  # Convert to integer
print(f"Next year you'll be {age + 1}")

# One-liner conversion
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))

# Reading multiple values
# User enters: 10 20 30
numbers = input("Enter three numbers separated by spaces: ")
a, b, c = map(int, numbers.split())
print(f"Sum: {a + b + c}")
```

**Interview Tip**: Always validate user input!
```python
# Safe input handling
while True:
    try:
        age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
        if age < 0:
            print("Age cannot be negative!")
            continue
        break
    except ValueError:
        print("Please enter a valid number!")

print(f"Your age is {age}")
```

## Comments in Python

```python
# This is a single-line comment

# You can use comments to explain your code
age = 25  # Inline comment

"""
This is a multi-line comment (docstring).
It can span multiple lines.
Often used for documentation.
"""

'''
You can also use single quotes
for multi-line comments
'''

# Interview Tip: Write comments for WHY, not WHAT
# Bad comment:
x = 5  # Assigning 5 to x

# Good comment:
x = 5  # Number of retries before giving up
```

## Common Pitfalls for Beginners

### 1. Indentation Matters!

```python
# Python uses indentation to define code blocks
# ✅ Correct
if True:
    print("This is indented")
    print("This too")

# ❌ Wrong (mixing tabs and spaces)
# if True:
#     print("Spaces")
# 	print("Tab")  # IndentationError!

# Best Practice: Use 4 spaces (not tabs)
```

### 2. Variable Names Are Case-Sensitive

```python
name = "Alice"
Name = "Bob"
NAME = "Charlie"

print(name)  # Alice
print(Name)  # Bob
print(NAME)  # Charlie
# These are three different variables!
```

### 3. String Immutability

```python
message = "Hello"
# message[0] = "J"  # ❌ TypeError: strings are immutable

# ✅ Create a new string instead
message = "J" + message[1:]  # "Jello"
```

### 4. Integer Division vs Float Division

```python
print(10 / 3)   # 3.333... (float division)
print(10 // 3)  # 3 (integer/floor division)
print(10 % 3)   # 1 (modulus/remainder)

# Interview favorite: Check if number is even
number = 10
if number % 2 == 0:
    print("Even")
```

## Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Basic Calculator
```python
# Create a simple calculator
num1 = float(input("Enter first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter second number: "))
operation = input("Enter operation (+, -, *, /): ")

if operation == "+":
    result = num1 + num2
elif operation == "-":
    result = num1 - num2
elif operation == "*":
    result = num1 * num2
elif operation == "/":
    if num2 != 0:
        result = num1 / num2
    else:
        result = "Cannot divide by zero"
else:
    result = "Invalid operation"

print(f"Result: {result}")
```

### Exercise 2: Temperature Converter
```python
# Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit
celsius = float(input("Enter temperature in Celsius: "))
fahrenheit = (celsius * 9/5) + 32
print(f"{celsius}°C = {fahrenheit}°F")

# Bonus: Convert back
kelvin = celsius + 273.15
print(f"{celsius}°C = {kelvin}K")
```

### Exercise 3: Age Calculator
```python
# Calculate age from birth year
current_year = 2025
birth_year = int(input("Enter your birth year: "))
age = current_year - birth_year
print(f"You are approximately {age} years old")

# Bonus: Calculate days lived (approximate)
days = age * 365
print(f"You've lived approximately {days:,} days!")
```

## Interview Questions - Part 1

### Q1: What's the difference between `=` and `==`?
**Answer**:
- `=` is assignment operator (assigns value)
- `==` is comparison operator (checks equality)

```python
x = 5      # Assignment: x gets the value 5
x == 5     # Comparison: Is x equal to 5? Returns True
```

### Q2: What are mutable vs immutable types?
**Answer**:
- **Immutable**: Cannot be changed after creation (int, float, str, tuple)
- **Mutable**: Can be modified (list, dict, set)

```python
# Immutable example
text = "hello"
# text[0] = "H"  # Error!

# Mutable example
numbers = [1, 2, 3]
numbers[0] = 10  # ✅ Works fine
```

### Q3: How do you swap two variables in Python?
**Answer**:
```python
# Pythonic way (one line)
a, b = 10, 20
a, b = b, a
print(a, b)  # 20 10

# Traditional way (using temp variable)
a, b = 10, 20
temp = a
a = b
b = temp
```

### Q4: What will this print?
```python
x = 5
y = 2
print(x / y)
print(x // y)
print(x % y)
```
**Answer**:
- `2.5` (float division)
- `2` (integer division)
- `1` (remainder)

## Key Takeaways

✅ Variables store data and don't need type declarations
✅ Python has 5 main primitive types: int, float, str, bool, None
✅ Use `snake_case` for variable names
✅ `input()` always returns a string—convert as needed
✅ f-strings are the modern way to format output
✅ Indentation matters in Python
✅ Comments explain WHY, not WHAT

## What's Next?

In **Part 2**, we'll dive into:
- Conditional statements (if, elif, else)
- Loops (for and while)
- Pattern matching (match-case)
- Break, continue, and pass statements
- Nested loops and loop patterns

---

**Practice Challenge**: Before moving to Part 2, write a program that:
1. Asks for user's name
2. Asks for their age
3. Calculates birth year
4. Prints a formatted message with all the information

Try it yourself before checking the solution!

**Solution**:
```python
name = input("Enter your name: ")
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
current_year = 2025
birth_year = current_year - age

print(f"""
=== User Information ===
Name: {name}
Age: {age}
Birth Year: {birth_year}
========================
""")
```

Keep practicing, and see you in Part 2! 🐍
